Build a simple calculator in Android. It should have only one Activity but you can use the layout and views that you want. We suggest using LinearLayout or TableLayout.

It should have the following operations:

Add
Substract
Multiply
Division
Equals (Execute the operation)
Clear (Empty the number and cancel pending operation if any)
Sin
Cos
Tan
For the trigonometric operations, it is needed to select if the numbers are expressed in degrees or radians. You can use buttons, switches or combos for this.

It is not needed to apply the priority of the operations, you can execute them left to right. For example, 1+2*5 can be 15 instead of 11.
